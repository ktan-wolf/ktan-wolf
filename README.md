## ⚡ Showcase 

### Project
- [W3:Terminal](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/W3Terminal_server) - W3:Terminal Engine is a high-frequency, quantum-styled cryptocurrency arbitrage terminal. It fuses a multi-threaded Rust backend with a holographic Next.js frontend to visualize and capture liquidity fractures across Centralized (CEX) and Decentralized (DEX) exchanges in real-time.


- [AetherNet-DePIN](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/AetherNet-DePIN) - A Solana DePIN project built with Anchor for deploying decentralized physical infrastructure via blockchain automation.
- [Indexer](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Indexer) - A high-performance blockchain indexer built in Rust for fetching on-chain data and integrating seamlessly with frontend dApps. 

- [YAP](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/YAP) - A MERN-stack TypeScript clone of Twitter enabling posts, likes, comments, followers, and real-time notifications.
- [Wallet App](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/wallet-app) - A lightweight TypeScript/React wallet app for managing personal finances and tracking expenses.
- [NoteSaver](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Note-Saver-App) - A React-based note-taking application with intuitive UI, quick save and edit features for everyday productivity.

### Cli Tools
- [Rust Terminal](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Rust-Terminal) - A lightweight Rust-based terminal CLI interface that offers streamlined command-line workflows with minimal overhead.
- [Cargo-Inspect](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Cargo-Inspect) - A Rust-based CLI tool to inspect and analyze Cargo projects and their dependencies.
- [Native Rust Http Server](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Rust-http-Server) - A native Rust HTTP server built from scratch without frameworks like Axum, focusing on low-level networking and request handling.
### Contracts
#### Pinocchio
- [Escrow](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Pinocchio-Escrow) - A Solana escrow smart-contract built with the zero-dependency Pinocchio SDK, enabling trustless asset exchanges via native Rust.
- [Quantum Vault](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Pinocchio-Quantum-Vault) - A high-security vault smart contract on Solana using the zero-dependency Pinocchio SDK for quantum-resistant asset storage.
- [Native Vault](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Pinocchio-Native-Vault) - A native Rust smart contract vault on Solana built using Pinocchio (no Anchor, no traditional framework) for ultra-lean, high-performance asset storage.
- [Counter](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Pinocchio_Counter) - A simple state-incrementing smart contract example using the zero-dependency Pinocchio framework on Solana.
#### Anchor
- [NFT Maketplace](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/NFT-Contract) - A Rust smart contract built with Anchor on Solana for minting and managing NFTs.
- [Flash Loan](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Anchor_flash_loan) - A flash-loan smart contract on Solana using Anchor for atomic borrowing and repayment in a single transaction.
- [Staking](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/AetherNet-DePIN) - An Anchor-based Solana smart contract for token staking and reward distribution with secure, programmatic yield logic.
- [Escrow](https://github.com/ktan-wolf/Escrow-Contract) - An Anchor-based Solana smart contract for trustless escrow operations between parties.
